    <h1>About Helpin</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to Helpin, the heart of community-driven exchange. We believe that everyone has something to offer and everyone has a need to be met. Our platform was born from a simple idea: what if we could make it easy for neighbors to help each other?
    </p>
    <p>
      In a world that's more connected digitally but often disconnected locally, Helpin bridges the gap. We're not just a marketplace; we're a community hub. We empower you to lend that power drill you use twice a year, rent out your spare room for a weekend, or offer your skills as a tutor to a local student.
    </p>
